## C - File I/O
In this project, I learned about the three standard file descriptors and their POSIX names as well as the difference between function and system calls. I practiced using the I/O system calls open, close, read, and write and the flags O_RDONLY, WR_ONLY, and O_RDWR to create, open, close, read, write, set permissions of files in C.

## Header File ğŸ“

## Tasks ğŸ“ƒ
â€¢ 0. Tread lightly, she is near

Â[°0-read_textfile.c]: C function that reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output.

Â°The parameter letters is the number of letters the function should read and print.

Â°If the file is NULL or cannot be opened or read - returns 0.

Â°If the write call fails or does not write the expected number of bytes - returns 0.

Â°Otherwise - returns the actual number of bytes the function can read and print.

â€¢1. Under the snow

Â<Down>°1-create_file.c: C function that creates a file.

Â°The paramter filename is the name of the file to create.

Â°The parameter text_content is a null-terminated string to write to the file.

Â°If text_content is NULL, the function creates an empty file.

Â°The created file has the permissions rw-------.

Â°If the file already exists, the existing permissions are not changed.

Â°Existing files are truncated.

Â°If filename is NULL or the funciton fails - returns -1.

Â°Otherwise - returns 1 on success.

â€¢2. Speak gently, she can hear

Â[°2-append_text_to_file.c]: C function that appends text at the end of a file.

Â°The parameter filename is the name of the file.

Â°The parameter text_content is a null-terminated string to append to the file.
<Down>
Â°The function does not create the file if it does not exist.
<Up>
Â°If text_content is NULL, nothing is added to the file.

Â°If the function fails or filename is NULL - returns -1.

Â°If the file does not exist or the user lacks write permissions on the file - returns -1.

ÂOtherwise - returns 1.
â€¢ 3. cp

Â[°3-cp.c]: C program that copies the contents of a file to another file.

Â°Usage: cp file_from file_to

Â°If file_to already exists, it is truncated.

Â°The created file has the permissions rw-rw-r--.

Â°If the file already exists, the existing permissions are not changed.

Â°If the number of arguments is incorrect, the function prints Usage: cp file_from file_to, followed by a new line on the POSIX standard error and exits with code 97.

Â°If file_from does not exist or the user lacks read permissions on it, the function prints Error: Can't read from file NAME_OF_THE_FILE, followed by a new line and exits with code 98.

â€¢Where NAME_OF_THE_FILE is the first argument passed to the program.
Â°If files cannot be created or if write to file_to fails, the function prints Error: Can't write to NAME_OF_THE_FILE, followed by a new line and exits with code 99.
â€¢°Where NAME_OF_THE_FILE is the second argument passed to the program.
Â°If the user cannot close a file descriptor, the function prints Error: Can't close fd FD_VALUE, followed by a new line on the POSIX standard error and exits with code 100.
â€¢Where FD_VALUE is the value of the file descriptor.
â€¢ 4. elf

Â[°100-elf_header.]c: C program that displays the information contained in the ELF header at the start of an ELF file.
Â°Usage elf_header elf_filename
Â°Displayed information:
â€¢Magic
â€¢Class
â€¢Data
â€¢Version
â€¢OS/ABI
â€¢ABI Version
â€¢Type
â€¢Entry point address
Â°Format is identical to readelf -h (version 2.26.1).
Â°If an error occurs or the file is not an ELF file, the function displays a corresponding error message to stderr and exits with a status value of 98.
